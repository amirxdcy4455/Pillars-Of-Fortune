**Pillars of Fortune** is an exciting Minecraft Bedrock minigame plugin for PocketMine-MP. Players fight to be the last one standing across dynamically created and reset game worlds. Developed by **TheWindows** and **Doma**, now on **v2.0.0** with major improvements to world management, spectating, scoreboards, and configuration.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: Powered by FormAPI, players can join games, spectate, view stats, and access the market through intuitive menus.
- **Scoreboard Integration**: Built-in scoreboard system with fully customizable lines and placeholders for lobby, waiting, game, and spectator states.
- **Boss Bar Support**: Uses the apibossbar virion to show item drop countdowns during games.
- **NPC Management**: Admins can create, list, and remove NPCs that open the game menu when hit.
- **Spectator System**: Players can spectate active games from the lobby or after dying, with a compass to teleport to alive players.
- **Flexible Commands**: A full command system with short aliases for quick access.
- **JSON & MySQL Support**: Choose your database provider in `config.yml`. Falls back to JSON automatically if MySQL fails.

## Requirements

- PocketMine-MP API 5

> **Note**: The lobby world name defaults to `world`. Change it in `config.yml` if needed.
